### Short description  
The Hope Garden is a community asset for the people of Cilgerran and the surrounding area. Features include a Community Assembly covered area, for outdoor workshops & gatherings. It is surrounded by a thoughtfully designed garden, with a wide range of perennial vegetables and edible shrubs, plus a wealth of artfully chosen native wild flowers. Native plants are used where possible as food for co-evolved insects, and wildlife habitat and sustainable practices are built into the infrastructure of the garden.
