## 1. Community Assembly

A Community Assembly is an effective and empowering way to build real participatory democracy into local decision making through a structured process. It  brings communities of interest together in inclusive decision making. The process provides a safe and equitable space with radical inclusivity, active listening and trust in the process at its foundations. Trained facilitators and note-takers support participants in coming to consensus on shared goals.

### 3 stage process

1. **Input** — This is where the Community Assembly process is explained, with hand signals used, followed by the framing of the main question. This can be supplemented with a presentation by a practitioner from the field in question. There is also a trained assembly facilitator and note-taker.
2. **Deliberation** — The assembly is split up into breakout groups of about 6. The community space of the Hope Garden is visually divided into three sections and there are light wooden benches to accomodate the groups. Each group has its own facilitator and note-taker, who then guide and note the ensuing conversation about the main question.
3. **Integration** - The assembly is brought back together so that the outcomes from the groups are collated and synthesised, and the key points of the assembly are drawn out. It is also made clear _where_ this information will be used.

### Three pillars

1. **Radical inclusivity** — an emphasis on all being heard and valued equally means no voices dominate and the collective wisdom of the assembly is harnessed. People can participate safely and openly without fear of judgement. It also means being aware of potential barriers to engagement.
2. **Active listening** — a focus on hearing someone all the way through before developing responses, Community Assemblies are spaces which recognise that no one person or group holds all the answers, and that it is through the wisdom of the crowds that we gain powerful intelligence about the issues being discussed.
3. **Trust in the process** — it is essential that all participants trust the process, trust the facilitators and trust the various working groups involved. Community Assemblies can only be effective if people trust that those involved have come together in humility, to work towards decisions and actions that are best for all.

## 2. Wildlife gardening

Every garden has the potential to be a wildlife garden. The two key elements are habitat and food.

## 3. Forest garden

Forest gardening works with nature to grow edible crops, by emulating a woodland edge, with layered trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials, such that the area provides its own nutrients, with nitrogen and potassium rich plants, and natural, ecological pest control through developing a diverse, balanced and resilient ecosystem.
