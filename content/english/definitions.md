## Community Assembly

A Community Assemblies is an effective and empowering way to build real participatory democracy into local decision making through a structured process. It  brings communities of interest together in inclusive decision making. The process provides a safe and equitable space for decision making with radical inclusivity, active listening and trust in the process at its foundations. Trained facilitators and note-takers support participants in coming to consensus on shared goals.

### Three stage process

1. Input - The first stage of a Community Assembly is the Setup. This is where the process is explained, with hand signals used, followed by the framing of the main question of the assembly is framed. This can be supplemented with an explanation/presentation by a practitioner from that specific field in focus. There is also an assembly facilitator and note-taker.
2. Deliberation - The second stage is the Deliberation, where the assembly is split up into breakout groups of about 6. The community space of the Hope Garden is visually divided into three sections and there are light wooden benches to accomodate the groups. Each group has its own facilitator and note-taker, who then guide and note the ensuing conversation about the main question.
3. Integration - The final stage is the Integration, where the outcomes from the groups are collated and synthesised, and the key points of the assembly are drawn out. Also, it is made clear _where_ this information will be used.

### Three pillars

1. Radical inclusivity
2. Active listening
3. Trust in the process

## Wildlife garden

Every garden has the potential to be a wildlife garden. The two key elements are habitat and food.

## Forest garden

Forest gardening works with nature to grow edible crops, by emulating a woodland edge, with layered trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials, such that the area provides its own nutrients, with nitrogen and potassium rich plants, and natural, ecological pest control through developing a diverse, balanced and resilient ecosystem.
