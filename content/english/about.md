In a world portrayed as riven by division, we need hope and inspiration to celebrate and capitalise upon our diversity. Bring the people together in nature, to have the conversations required to prepare for a more equitable future.

The Hope Garden is a shining example of a participatory democratic space and culture at the heart of a wildlife forest garden, filled with nature and edible crops. 

All the plans are available for free for you to create your own Hope Garden.
