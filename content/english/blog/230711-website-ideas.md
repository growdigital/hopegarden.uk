* Invite **local** schools to an assembly
* Actually, use events theme for website, keep aingle page at beginning, then when get bookongs, switch on achedule and speakers/sessions
* Use single page scroll website, for when fundraising starts. [Hugo scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) is the theme, [demo here](https://zjedi.github.io/hugo-scroll/)
* David Hunter, woodworker Iâ€™d like to use for benches [thecoppiceplot.com](https://thecoppiceplot.com/about/)
* Open source the plans and process
* Bilingual, backed by Welsh govt?
* Will email Jane Davidson, one of the architects of the [Future Generations Act](https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/) may well be interested in the project, as she apparently supports Community Assemblies.
