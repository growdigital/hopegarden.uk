Finally, itâ€™s up and running. I was considering using [Beehiiv](https://beehiiv.com) as the newsletter platform but they donâ€™t have a configurable subscribe form and they also donâ€™t have the â€˜RSS (ie blog posts) to automatic newsletterâ€™ feature. So, [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) it is.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter your email address!

Yes, there will be plants soonâ€¦
