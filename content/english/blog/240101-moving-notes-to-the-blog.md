* Reworking website to become simple blog, for now. So rather than adding updates here [grwd.uk/hope/notes](https://grwd.uk/hope/notes), I'll add progress to the website [hopegarden.uk](https://hopegarden.uk/)
* Old theme I used from [GetHugoThemes](https://gethugothemes.com/) was [Vixcon](https://gethugothemes.com/products/vixcon). Might be suitable in future
* New theme is simple blog theme [Bookworm](https://gethugothemes.com/products/bookworm). Can always copy content over to new, more complex theme if need be
* Also using [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), a simple content management system for static websites. This means easier for people to add blog entries.
