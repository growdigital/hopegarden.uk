Iâ€™m in the process of making an application for the Prototype Hope Garden. The medium term aim is to have a show garden at RHS Hampton Court in 2025. The idea is to create a prototype so that the show garden is informed by an actual real life working garden. 

The site is Pen Y Foidr allotments in my local village. I am getting to meet the landowners and the allotmenteers, and the design itself will be a co-design process (as all good design should be IMO ie listening on both sides). 

The downside is more form filling, to [Local Places for Nature Capital Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/local-places-nature), and the deadline for the 2nd round is 12th March. 

[Local Places for Nature](https://www.gov.wales/evaluation-local-places-nature-2021-22) is a Welsh government initiative, providing a 3 pronged approach to providing nature for the areas of highest deprivation, by providing packages via [Keep Wales Tidy](https://keepwalestidy.cymru/) for community projects, by grants through the [Local Places for Nature Capital Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/local-places-nature) and through embedded [Local Nature Partnerships](https://lnp.cymru/About-Us) in county councils.

To make my life easier, I created an [online checklist of my application process](https://grwd.cc/hope-app-checklist) using [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr) (a brilliant, secure & free platform for sharing documents).

## 1.1 Tell us about your organisation's main purpose and activities*

<small>* All answers maximum of 500 words unless otherwise stated</small>

The organisation I am using to make the application is a [Community Interest Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) I set up called [Garden Wild Plants CIC](https://gardenwild.org.uk/). A couple of colleagues are co-directors, Martin Hayes (orchardist) and Daniel Richards (well-being), and they have helped with previous grant applications.

Really, the CIC is a vehicle to make grant applications to promote community wildlife forest gardening and, just as importantly, to bring like-minded people together. There are 6 collaborators on the Hope Garden: Alex (garden designer), Audley (ex-gardener, therapist & climate activist), Beth (gardener and public relations), Denise (democracy advocate & community activist), Lindy (fundraiser). Garden Wild is a way to bring people together and make the grant application.

## Answer

Garden Wild Plants is a Community Interest Company whose main purpose is to promote wildlife forest gardening in the context of community climate resilience. The CIC is a vehicle for accessing funding, coordinating collaborators and working with partner organisations.

A forest garden works with nature to grow edible crops by emulating woodland edge, with self-sustaining nutrients and pest control and layers of mostly perennial plants.
