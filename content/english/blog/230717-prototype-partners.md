* [The People v Climate Change](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p097sbzc)
* Four possible sites
  1. Naturewise Community Forest Garden, [Cardigan](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=aberteifi&ia=web&iaxm=maps&strict_bbox=0&bbox=52.055869154726594%2C-4.346676145782453%2C52.02633084566017%2C-4.272303854217512) - still waiting to hear back from Claire Turner. Ideally sited, next to the police station within walking distance of Cardigan
  2. Yr Ardd community garden, [Llandysul](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=llandysul&ia=web&iaxm=about) - don't know much about the project, think it's in the town, I know one of the directors vaguely, strong Welsh links
  3. Meads Project, [Milford Haven](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=Meads+Ct&ia=web&iaxm=maps&strict_bbox=0&bbox=51.73131000132282%2C-5.069970135626676%2C51.70657610132282%2C-5.008139164373318&metatoken=1) - early co-design stages. Bit of a trek (1 hour) for me but really interesting project using community assemblies
  4. Abergwili, Carmarthen - via Audley. [Parc yr Esgob](https://parcyresgob.org.uk/)?
* [Ffion Gwyn](https://www.ffiongwyn.co.uk/collections/frontpage), artist using Welsh wildlife names. Appeared on Countryfile
* Public access RHS Hampton Court:
> “For gardens over 80m2, walk-through access is possible and should be specified on the application form (one-way access
requires a minimum path width of 1.5m; two-way access requires a minimum path width of 2m)

> The questions and framing of the questions is crucial to getting a successful outcome. If eg 2.5 hours per assembly, the rule of thumb is equal division of time between INTRO phase / DELIBERATION phase and OUTPUT / COLLATION  phase.<br>_Denise XR Gardener_

So, 2½ hour assembly would have 50 minutes for intro, deliberation and collation phases.
