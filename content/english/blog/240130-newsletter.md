Welcome to the first issue of the weekly Hope Garden newsletter. This is a blog post [written on the website](https://hopegarden.uk/categories/newsletter/) and then relayed to all the newsletter subscribers.

## News

### New year, new job

I applied for a part-time post as a Biodiversity Assistant with the local council, and Iâ€™ve just found out that itâ€™s been approved! This is exciting news, well, for me. My background is in design and gardening, so I will have a **lot** to learn. Iâ€™m also used to working with private businesses rather than local government, so that should be another new landscape to explore. 

It will be fantastic experience for the Hope Garden, as I can incorporate what I learn about ecology and council practises into the garden design.

Itâ€™s three days a week for a few months at least, so I will be working on the Hope Garden the rest of the week.

### Pen Y Foidr mini-presentation

I gave a short presentation about the Hope Garden to the [Pen Y Foidr](https://ffynnoneresilience.org.uk/penyfoidr/) allotments on Monday 29th January. As they are **the** partner in the project, it was important that I fairly represent the Hope Garden! I am seriously out of practise with public speaking, so I was pretty darned nervous. But I had my 5 minute speech sketched out on an index card, so at least I said the important bits!

People were receptive though, so it was a good meeting. The main point was about **maintenance**. I am glad of this, because there are 3 big questions in gardening:

1. Who does the maintenance?
2. Where does the water go?
3. Whoâ€™s paying?

Note that none of these questions are directly related to plants!
