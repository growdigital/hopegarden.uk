> “Can gardens literally save the world? No…<br>
Gardens can save the world by saving us. They can bring us back into contact with diversity…<br>
Gardens as activism as surely as any art form…<br>
Gardens that stir our senses and give us actionable faith and hope.”<br><br>
_~ Benjamin Vogt, A New Garden Ethic pp158_
