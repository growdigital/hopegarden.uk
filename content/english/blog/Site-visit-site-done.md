Well, I have \*\*just\*\* about finished the basic functionality of the website, meaning blog posts can be written using a web browser rather than a too-technical text editor.

And I took a visit to the potential site of the Prototype Hope Garden in my local village, by the allotment. I even made a little video.

Now starts the work of making the grant application from Local Places for Nature. The deadline is 12th March. I will be writing up the application online as well, all in the spirit of Open Source and for everyone who wants to create their own Hope Garden.
