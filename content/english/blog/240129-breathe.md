I gave a mini-presentation to the [Pen Y Foidr](https://ffynnoneresilience.org.uk/penyfoidr/) allotments tonight, only a 5 minute slot at the end of their meeting. 

It’s important because it’s the first time I’ve seen them as a group, rather than in the group chat (very different things) and as partners on the prototype Hope Garden project, it’s essential for everyone to be happy. So, of course, I was silly nervous. I was only supposed to have 5 minutes but I’m sure it was much longer! 

Community Assembly, wildlife garden, forest garden: each of these is a vast topic in its own right, so trying to convey the potential of the idea in a short time was quite tricky. Also, I’ve fallen out of practise talking with groups.

Anyways, I _think_ it went well, will post to the group chat later with some questions.
