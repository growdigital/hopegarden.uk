I managed to finish building the basic blog functionality of this website last night. Without getting too technical, it means that there is a blog writing interface using a web browser for any of the participants, and all without incurring any hosting costs.

The next step is to start writing the grant application for Local Places for Nature, a Welsh government scheme. The deadline is 12th March. I will be posting the progress using this blog, so other members of the team can see whatâ€™s happening, as well as keeping it nice and open for any else who wants to create a Hope Garden.

I also took a walk up to the allotments this afternoon, had a look around and made a small video. It is very wet, and boggy, partly because water pipes have been put in and the digger compacted the soil.
