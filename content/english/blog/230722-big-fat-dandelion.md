* Plant a big fat Dandelion front and centre. Edible, native wild flower, great for pollinators.
* Bugle, Yarrow, Meadowsweet. I will start adding these to [spreadsheet](https://grwd.cc/hope-plants)
* Cheap, repurposed agricultural water trough as central water feature? Idea is to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-design_movement) plans and costings, and make garden affordable for other community projects.

* I spoke briefly with Natalie from RHS last week, she said 'size not an issue' at Hampton Court, so more leeway on width than 10m
