If you have any questions you‚Äôd like answered about Community Assemblies, forest gardens or wildlife gardening, just let me know via email <hello@hopegarden.uk>

## 1. News

### Grant application

The final two weeks before the grant application has to be submitted. There are lots of revisions and rewriting and revisiting ideas, which takes up a lot of time.

The core idea of the Hope Garden is simple: provide an inspirational meeting place for local democracy in a wildlife and perennial edible garden, a place where positive action can be experienced and discussed, and repeated across the land.

But it‚Äôs a lot of words, a lot of budgeting, estimates, considerations. By next week‚Äôs newsletter, the budgets will be done, and the final draft will be ready for picking over one last time!

### Wildlife features

I had a lovely meeting with Marianne Jones, who is the conservationist and landscape designer onboard with the Hope Garden. We discussed a whole range of topics, centred around the idea of the Hope Garden.

I don‚Äôt have any formal ecological training, so Marianne will be providing much-needed experience and expertise for the ecological aspects of the Hope Garden. I asked the hypothetical question ‚ÄúHow much wildlife diversity can you fit into one small garden?‚Äù and I‚Äôve drawn up a list of [potential wildlife features](https://natureworks.org.uk/wildlife-features) on my own website.

### Wild flowers in vogue

I‚Äôve signed up for quite a few gardening mailing lists, and this one from [Hayloft](https://hayloft.co.uk/) nursery caught my eye. ‚Äúüå∏&nbsp;Join The Wildflower Revolution!&nbsp;üå∏‚Äù it declaims in the email header! Yes, wild flowers **are in fashion**. Now, this is a good thing. But, buy from your local wild flower nursery if you can. For example, in West Wales we have [The Wildflower Nursery](https://www.thewildflowernursery.co.uk/) in Haverfordwest and [Celtic Wild Flowers](https://celticwildflowers.co.uk/) just outside Swansea. I like Hayloft too but I am also keen to support local businesses. Before the Big Companies muscle in with their peat-enriched, genetically-modified, climate-controlled, pesticide-drenched wild flower wannabes.

### We‚Äôre on TV!

I‚Äòve always wanted to say that. It‚Äôs not exactly true though. What‚Äôs happened is that Vicky from [WoodlandsTV](https://www.woodlands.co.uk/tv/) has asked if we would like a film promoting the Hope Garden and its values, with a ‚Äòbefore‚Äô film outlining the aims and definitions of what we‚Äôre trying to achieve, and an ‚Äôafter‚Äô film, once everything is blossoming. 

I said yes.

It will be magnificent üíö

## 4. Hope

>  Our project organisers  believe that heritage is intangible too. Hence, we aim to build stronger decision making skills in our community, by introducing the concepts and practices of deliberative democracy, as seen in community assemblies happening all around the UK right now. Citizenship supports resilience of natural, built and community heritage. Without those inclusive deliberation skills, the tangible outcomes are unsustainable.<br><br>_~ Denise, writing in our grant application_

I love what Denise has written here, the importance of citizenship in protecting our heritage.
