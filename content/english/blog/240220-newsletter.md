Welcome to the third issue of the weekly Hope Garden newsletter. It‚Äôs raining in West Wales, again. But this has not dampened our spirits, as we look forward to submitting our grant application in the next couple of weeks. 

Any suggestions, comments, ideas, please feel free to email me on <hello@hopegarden.uk>

### Grant application budget

We‚Äôve reached the budget part of the grant application, and this is where things get nitty and gritty. It‚Äôs appropriate, nay, _necessary_ that the design and creation of the prototype Hope Garden follows the processes of Community Assemblies. This means that (grant willing) the garden will be **co-designed** and **co-created** by the people who will be using the space. 

So, last issues [workshops, workshops, workshops](https://hopegarden.uk/blog/240214-newsletter/#workshops-workshops-workshops) mantra is making it into the budget, and there will be budgets for a slew of Community Assembly run workshops, including but not limited to:

1. **Ecological survey** ‚Äî the base survey, before any work commences, and then instructions for subsequent surveys, to measure wildlife impacts
2. **Co-design** ‚Äî possibly 3 workshops, with special guests providing inputs, from a wildlife perspective, a practical community perspective, and an outdoor well-being workshop perspective
3. **Landscaping** ‚Äî hard landscaping, how the structure of the garden is created; planting & pruning for the long term; making wooden benches

The other task is to reach out to more local charities and organisations to sound out their interest, and a jolly testimonial would be nice as well.

### Ffynnone Resilience

I have written a blog post for [Ffynnone Resilience](https://ffynnoneresilience.org.uk/) about the Hope Garden and Community Assemblies, which should be [appearing on their news page](https://ffynnoneresilience.org.uk/blog-news-updates/) any day soon.

### Hope Garden definitions

It‚Äôs always handy to know what you‚Äôre talking about, so I‚Äòve made [a definitions page](https://hopegarden.uk/definitions) for the Hope Garden. The idea is to have an ‚Äúelevator pitch‚Äù of one sentence, and then a bit more detail.

1. **Community Assembly** ‚Äî A Community Assembly is an effective and empowering way to build real participatory democracy into local decision making through a structured process, bringing communities of interest together in inclusive decision making.
2. **Forest garden** ‚Äî A forest garden works with nature to grow edible crops. It is sustainable, low maintenance and wildlife friendly and emulates the woodland edge using edible perennial and ground cover plants. Essentially, it is an **edible ecosystem**. 
3. **Wildlife garden** ‚Äî Every garden has the potential to be a wildlife garden by ensuring the presence of the two key elements, habitat and food.

This is, and probably shall remain, a work in progress, ever-evolving.
